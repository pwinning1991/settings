# This is just some settings for Vim and different shells

### Prereqs
- You will need vim and git installed
- I keep a .bashrc for when I am working on a system that does not have zsh installed.
- To use the .zshrc you will need to have zsh installed and use the chsh -u "path to zsh" 
- Usually the path is /bin/zsh put you can find it with the `which zsh` command


### Usage
- You can clone the repo and then link the files to your ~/.vimrc or your ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc
- I usually change my vimrc depening on the project and applications I am working on.
-  That is why I maintain multiple versions of the vimrc and then link to the .vimrc file depending on what I am working on
