# This is just some settings for Vim and different shells

### Usage
> You can clone the repo and then link the files to your ~/.vimrc or your ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc
> I usually change my vimrc depening on the project and applications I am working on.
> That is why I maintain multiple versions of the vimrc and then link to the .vimrc file depending on what I am working on
